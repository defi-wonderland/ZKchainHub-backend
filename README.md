# ZKchainHub - Backend

## Description

ZKchainHub is envisioned as a permissionless, cloud-agnostic platform that allows anyone to deploy an instance, specifically focusing on the settlement chain.
You can fetch metrics from the ZKsync ecosystem and ZK chains from L1 RPC (Ethereum). Optionally, it will also fetch data from L2 RPCs for the chains where the user provides the RPC.

## üìã Prerequisites

- Ensure you have `node >= 20.0.0` and `pnpm >= 9.0.0` installed.

## Installation

```bash
$ pnpm install
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting up env variables

- Create `.env` file in the `root` folder and copy paste `.env.example` content in there.
```
$ cp .env.example .env
```
- Set up `L1_RPC_URLS` as CSV list of RPC URLs. For example, `https://eth.llamarpc.com,https://rpc.flashbots.net/fast`. You can check [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/) for a list of public RPCs
- Set up `L2_RPC_URLS` as CSV list of RPC URLs. For example, `https://mainnet.era.zksync.io`. You can check [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/) for a list of public RPCs
- Set `CONIGECKO_API_KEY`, `CONIGECKO_BASE_URL` and `CONIGECKO_API_KEY` depending on your API plan. You can get an API Key creating an account on [Coingecko's site](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api)
- (Optionally) Set `PORT` on which API is made available. By default is port 3000
