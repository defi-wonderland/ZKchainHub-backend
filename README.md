# ZKchainHub - Backend

## Description

ZKchainHub is envisioned as a permissionless, cloud-agnostic platform that allows anyone to deploy an instance, specifically focusing on the settlement chain.
You can fetch metrics from the ZKsync ecosystem and ZK chains from L1 RPC (Ethereum). Optionally, it will also fetch data from L2 RPCs for the chains where the user provides the RPC.

## Overview

This repository is a monorepo consisting of 4 packages and 1 app:

-   [`@zkchainhub/shared`](./packages/shared): A library for shared configurations, constants, types, etc.
-   [`@zkchainhub/chain-providers`](./packages/chain-providers): A library that provides abstracted services over Viem providers to query blockchain data
-   [`@zkchainhub/pricing`](./packages/pricing): An extensible library that provides Pricing services to fetch token prices. Currently, only Coingecko provider is developed
-   [`@zkchainhub/metadata`](./packages/metadata): A library that exposes different providers for fetching chains and tokens metadata.
-   [`@zkchainhub/metrics`](./packages/metrics): A library that provides different aggregated metrics from the ZKsync ecosystem and ZK chains.
-   [`@zkchainhub/api`](./apps/api): An Express server that exposes an API where you can fetch information about ZKsync ecosystem and their chains, using the before mentioned libraries

## üìã Prerequisites

-   Ensure you have `node >= 20.0.0` and `pnpm >= 9.5.0` installed.
